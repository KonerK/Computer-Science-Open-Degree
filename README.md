# Open CS Degree

There is a lot to learn. After completing my degree in Computer Science from the University of Bath I felt as if there was still so much for me to learn with respect to the fundamentals that every Computer Scientist should understand well. So, this repository marks the online courses I am currently working through in an attempt to solidfy and develop my skills as a student of CS, mainly just for myself to maintain and keep track of all the things I want to learn regarding CS. Below is just the material that I want to to get through to become a better computer scientist. See ForestKnight for a) an incredible youtube channel, especially for those who love javascript, and b) his recommended courses for teaching yourself a full cs degree). 


# The Fundamentals (Year 1)

### 1) System Architecture
The goal here is to understand the the architecture of modern computer systems and operating systems. What is a computer? How does it store, represent and transmit data? Content should include: history of computing (overview), the von neumann (and some non-von neumann) architectures, SIMD to MIMD. Integer number representations, floating point numbers. Digital logic and boolean logic. I/O: Memory Maps, Polling, Interrupts. Busses, devices and device addresses. Basic assembler concepts: machine codes, instruction exectuion, addressing modes, CISC v RISC, register use, subroutine calls and the stack. 

The following courses tackle the above topics very well:
