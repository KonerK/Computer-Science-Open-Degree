# Open Source Computer Science Degree

This repository is a personal marker to keep track of the courses I have completed, and am completing, in order to be a better Computer Scientist. After completeing my CS degree at the University of Bath, I felt as though there was still much for me to master, and so have set out to fill in personal gaps. This repository may serve useful to anyone similarly wanting to study computer science, but does not know where to start.

I have split my learning into two parts: 'Fundamentals', topics which start to introduce essential skills in computer science (software development, system architecutre, etc), and 'Advanced', which focused on more specialised topics, such as Machine Larning and Advanced Algorithms. 

Moreover, this repository marks a journey of sharpening my CS skills. It is mainly a personal repository to keep track of courses, and books, I find interesting. See ForestKnight for a) and incredible youtube channel, especially for those who love javascript, and b) his recommended courses for teaching yourself a full CS degree : )
