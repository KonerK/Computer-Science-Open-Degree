# Open Source Computer Science Degree

After completing my Computer Science degree I felt as though there were many fundamentals I did not have time to master. This repository marks the courses I am working through in an attempt to sharpen my CS skills. It is mainly a personal repository to keep track of these courses, but see ForestKnight for a) and incredible youtube channel, especially for those who love javascript, and b) his recommended courses for teaching yourself a full CS degree.
