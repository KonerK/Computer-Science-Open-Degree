# Open Source Computer Science Degree

After completing my degree in Computer Science from the University of Bath I felt as though there were still many fundamentals that I wanted to master. This repository marks the courses/content I am working through in an attempt to solidfy my skills as a student of CS. It's mainly a way to keep track of the I want to personally get through to become a better computer scientist. See ForestKnight for a) and incredible youtube channel, especially for those who love javascript, and b) his recommended courses for teaching yourself a full CS degree.
