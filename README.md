# Open CS Degree

There is a lot to learn. After completing my degree in Computer Science from the University of Bath I felt as if there was still so much for me to know with respect to the fundamentals that every Computer Scientist should understand well. So, this repository marks the courses/content I am currently working through in an attempt to solidify and develop my skills as a student of CS, mainly just for myself to maintain and keep track of all the things I want to learn (i.e. the below is just the material that I personally want to get through to become a better computer scientist). See ForestKnight for a) an incredible youtube channel, especially for those who love javascript, and b) his recommended courses for teaching yourself a full CS degree. 


# Act 1 - The Fundamentals

### I - System Architecture
The goal here is to understand  the architecture of modern computer systems and operating systems. What is a computer? How does it store, represent and transmit data? Content should include: history of computing (overview), the von Neumann (and some other) architectures, SIMD to MIMD. Integer number representations, floating point numbers. Digital logic and boolean logic. I/O: Memory Maps, Polling, Interrupts. Busses, devices and device addresses. Basic assembler concepts: machine codes, instruction execution, addressing modes, CISC v RISC, register use, subroutine calls and the stack. 

The following courses tackle the above topics very well:

| [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Part I)][1]  | Hebrew University of Jerusalem |
| [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Part II)][2] | Hebrew University of Jerusalem |

### II - Principles of Programming

### III -  Networking & Databases

# Act 2 - Becoming a Computer Scientist

### I - Advanced Algorithms & Complexity / Theory of Computation
Algorithms are everywhere, and computer scientists must well-versed with a variety of common, important algorithms and data structures. 'Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships' - Linus Torvalds. Understanding different algorithms is not only intellectually stimulating, but is a key part of understanding the world today within physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics. Today, many rely on algorithms to simulate the real world in order to learn more about nature, and we're moving away from formula-based models. 

Computer Scientists, for a start, should be well versed in algorithm analysis (complexity), stacks and queues, sorting algorithms, elemental symbol tables, hashtables, balanced search trees. After understanding these concepts, we can move towards understanding more advanced algorithms such as those concerning graphs (BFS & DFS, Dijkstra's, etc), strings (regular expressions, KMP). Lastly, it is important to explore turing machines and intractibility (P vs NP).
