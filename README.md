# Open CS Degree

There is a lot to learn. After completing my degree in Computer Science from the University of Bath I felt as if there was still so much for me to know with respect to the fundamentals that every Computer Scientist should understand well. So, this repository marks the courses/content I am currently working through in an attempt to solidify and develop my skills as a student of CS, mainly just for myself to maintain and keep track of all the things I want to learn. E.g., the below is just the material that I personally want to get through to become a better computer scientist. See ForestKnight for a) an incredible youtube channel, especially for those who love javascript, and b) his recommended courses for teaching yourself a full CS degree. 


# Act 1 - The Fundamentals

### I - System Architecture
The goal here is to understand  the architecture of modern computer systems and operating systems. What is a computer? How does it store, represent and transmit data? Content should include: history of computing (overview), the von Neumann (and some other) architectures, SIMD to MIMD. Integer number representations, floating point numbers. Digital logic and boolean logic. I/O: Memory Maps, Polling, Interrupts. Busses, devices and device addresses. Basic assembler concepts: machine codes, instruction execution, addressing modes, CISC v RISC, register use, subroutine calls and the stack. 

The following courses tackle the above topics very well:
