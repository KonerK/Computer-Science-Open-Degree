# A Journey of Computer Science

Having studied Computer Science at University, I'm quite interested in the question of 'What is a Computer Scientist?' but also, more importantly, 'What should a Computer Scientist Know?' Searching online gives some common topics, but also some inconsistencies. For instance, many cite general topics such cybersecurity as a crucial skill for computer scientists, but also specific topics such as being fluent in [basic unix][1], yet I was not taught either of these during my degree. My university valued HCI and Machine Learning highly (as do I) and so I was taught these topics more thoroughly over topics such as Cyber Security. This [post][101] provides many useful insights, many of which I agree with. It appears, then, that this set of knowledge of which a Computer Scientist must know will depend on the university, country, and time that we are asking these question in. There will, of course, be topics that every Computer Scientist will have encountered (boolean algebra, sorting algorithms, etc), but we quickly reach a point of uncertainty: Should I know how to create my own programming language? Be able to describe the halting problem in detail or be able to implement regular expressions through different finite automata? Part of the answer to this question is 'What should a Computer Scientist Know?', really, is clear: a lot of what you learn should be what you actually want to learn, which will likely align with your future goals, whether this be aquiring a new job, wanting to create something cool using technology, or perhaps you just want to learn for fun.

Anyyway, I could endlessly about this, but that is besides the point. This repository marks the learning I want to embark on to sharpen my technical skills, gain new knowledge, but also just have fun learning about computer science. I have split this learning into multiple parts. First, we have the 'Fundamentals', topics which start to introduce what I, and likely many others, believe to be important topics essential to studying Computer Science. Then, we have 'Adanced' topics, which focus more on specialised topics within Computer Science that can be best understood after solidfying some fundamental cs knowledge. Lastly, is the 'Specialist' section, which is very particular, and reflects my own interests within Computer Science that I want to understand at a deep level. For instance, I love exploring and visualising data in different, and so am keen to spend a lot of time gaining the skills required of a data analyst ar data scientist (to hopefully become one, and become a good one!)

This repository may serve useful to anyone similarly wanting to study computer science, but does not know where to start, as many topics listed are modules that would appear as university modules. See ForrestKnight on youtube for a) an incredibly well-structured approach to eaching yourself a computer science degreee and b) some great javascript videos. 

Of course, this repository will change and adapt over time as I dive in and out of each course and add new ones that I think may be cool to explore one day. Any code and development I have completed for these courses will be stored in this repository as a personal marker for what I've learnt and studied! Last, but not least, this repository only looks into courses to help gain knowledge. However, to know computer science is to do computer science, so if you are reading this looking to self-teach Computer Science, following these courses will be very helpful, but going away and completing your own projects will be equally, if not a lot more, valuable.
