// CONTEXT

// Percolation:
// Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials:
// what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor?
// Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below),
// under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface)?
// Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such situations.

// The Problem:
// In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in the following question:
// if sites are independently set to be open with probability p (and therefore blocked with probability 1 âˆ’ p),
// what is the probability that the system percolates? When p equals 0, the system does not percolate; when p equals 1, the system percolates.
// When n is sufficiently large, there is a threshold value p* such that
// when p < p* a random n-by-n grid almost never percolates,
// and when p > p*, a random n-by-n grid almost always percolates.
// No mathematical solution for determining the percolation threshold p* has yet been derived.
// Your task is to write a computer program to estimate p*.
